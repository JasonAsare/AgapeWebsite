        <span>Agape Academy International, owned and operated by Agape Gospel Mission (AGM), was founded in 2007 for the sole purpose of providing excellent Christian education for the children of the Agape Children’s Home (ACH). In 2013, AGM decided to extend this ministry to help vulnerable Children at Risk (CAR) in our community. The student body was then comprised of children resident at ACH and selected community children at risk who were invited and sponsored to attend the school. The overwhelmingly positive academic and spiritual impact of the school was quickly seen on all students.
        In consideration of the socialization needs of the ACH students and the added benefit of larger class sizes and more student interaction, the leadership of AGM also took the decision in 2013 to invite select families to enroll and pay tuition. This expanded the student body to children from ACH, CAR, and select paying students. The purpose of the school remained unchanged – to provide quality education for the children of ACH. In discharging that mission, the school had also found a way to support vulnerable children in society and bless Christian families.</span>

            <h1>Curriculum</h1>
            <p>In each quarter, students usually complete one exam, two tests, and roughly twenty quizzes per subject, which are used to evaluate the students through an A-F grading scheme.
            Each course requires students to complete daily assignments such as classwork and homework.
            High school students are evaluated by a GPA scale out of 4.0.
            Our 12th Grade students are exposed to elective courses, specific courses which can be chosen by students over other electives
            Some elective courses, known as weighted or honors courses, are worth a 4.5 GPA score. These courses are Physics, Pre-Calculus, and Spanish 2.</p>
